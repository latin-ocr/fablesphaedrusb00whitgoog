PREFACE

FOR sonte long time past it has been wudely felt
that a reduction in the cost of Classical Works
· used in schools generally, and more especially in
those intended for boys of the middle classes, is

at once desirable and not difficult of accomplish-
¹ ment. For the most part only portions of authors
are read in the earlier stages of education, and a
pupil is taken from one work to another in each
successive half-year or term: so that a book
needlessly large and proportionably expensive is
laid aside aster a short and but partialuse.

ln order, therefore, to meet what ,is certainly a
want, Portions of the Classical Writers usually

read in Schools are now being issued under the
title os Guruunn senooLTnxrs 3 while, at the
request of various Masters‚ it has been determined
to add to the series some portions os, the Greek
T estacnent.

Each Tnxr is provided with a VocAcucAnu of
the words occurring in it ln every instance-with

the exception of Eutropius aud AEsop-the ori '
of a word, when known, is stated at the commi

mentor the article treat'rug ol lt, 'rt connected
